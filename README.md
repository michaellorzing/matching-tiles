# React: The Gathering

Test your memory! Each time you click a card, the cards displayed will shuffle. Don't click the same one twice, and your score will increase. 
Forget which one you click and select it a second time, you lose!


## Technologies Used

## Brief Explanation

This app uses React to create a dynamic front end which uses an array of objects that are held in state and then mapped through to print on the page. Each card has an id assigned to it and this id is pushed to an array in state of selected cards. Each time the user clicks, the cards shuffle. If the id does not appear in the selected array, the score increments. If it does, the game ends and the user is notified.
